## Welcome to the Automatic Zoom Attendance Tracker

You can use this service to automatically generate an attendance report from any of your past Zoom meetings.

### Let's Get Started

If you'd like to generate a report of only certain meetings, and those meetings all share a common word or phrase in the meeting name, you can filter by entering that word or phrase in the box below.

<form action="https://attendance-tracker.site/install" method="GET">
    <input type="text" id="identifier" name="identifier" placeholder="Weekly Grant Meeting">
    <button type="submit" id="submit">Generate</button>
</form>
