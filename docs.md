## Welcome to the Automatic Zoom Attendance Tracker Documentation

You can use this service to automatically generate an attendance report from any of your past Zoom meetings. You must have a Pro Zoom account to use this service.

When you visit the home page and click "Generate", you'll be able to authorize Attendance Tracker to access your Pro Zoom account. After you authorize, Attendance Tracker will iterate over a list of your past Zoom meetings and collect the participants for each. Once complete, you'll be directed to a table with four columns: **Meeting Name**, **Meeting Date**, **Participant Name** and **Participant Email**. You can view the table in your browser or download a copy as a CSV file.
